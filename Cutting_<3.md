Main Idea :
  Mini Cut - 4 ~ 6 weeks (Down 1% of Bodyweight Per Week)
  Very hard to stick, High chance to gain back fat

Work out :
  - Weight Training : 1 - 3 Times Per week (1 is the neccesary)
  - Cardio (Easy to Recover from) : 5,000 - 15k Step walk + Medium intensity cardio 2 - 3 Times Per week

Diet : 
  - Calories 2,600 -> 2,000 Cals (20%)
  - Same meal but more veg for more Volume, lower Cals
  - Snacks - Banana nice cream, Apple fritters, Frozen yogurt

After Mini Cut (Lower Mets 100 - 200 Cals)
  - Back to the same diet + Keep the activity with more weight training
